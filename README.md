## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the prevalence of diabetes at the **county level** in the United States using **machine learning models** and **geospatial analysis**. It explores how lifestyle, demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors contribute to diabetes, with a strong emphasis on regional variation and interpretability.

The analysis focuses on **2019 predictions**, using data from **2016 to 2018** for training.

---

## Objectives

- ‚úÖ Predict the **percentage of people diagnosed with diabetes** at the U.S. county level.
- ‚úÖ Identify and rank the **key factors** contributing to diabetes prevalence.
- ‚úÖ Analyze **regional disparities** using geospatial and clustering techniques.
- ‚úÖ Provide an **interpretable and reproducible** ML pipeline.

## Models Used

Several models were implemented and compared based on performance (R¬≤, RMSE):

| Model | Description | Final Use |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Linear Regression (Baseline)** | Simple model for comparison | ‚ùå |
| **Random Forest** | Non-linear ensemble model | ‚ùå |
| **Geographical Random Forest** | RF + latitude/longitude as predictors | ‚ùå |
| **XGBoost** | Gradient boosting model with SHAP analysis | ‚úÖ **Selected** |

The final model, **XGBoost**, was chosen for its balance of **predictive power** and **interpretability**, with:
- `R¬≤ test = 0.4158`
- `RMSE test = 0.7643`

## Technical Highlights

### Libraries used
- `pandas` / `numpy` ‚Äì Data cleaning and manipulation  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` ‚Äì Visualization  
- `scikit-learn` ‚Äì Linear regression, preprocessing, model selection  
- `xgboost` ‚Äì Final machine learning model  
- `shap` ‚Äì Model interpretability with SHAP values  
- `kmeans` from `scikit-learn` ‚Äì Clustering counties  
- `geopandas` / `plotly` / `folium` ‚Äì Spatial mapping of results

## Model Interpretation (SHAP)

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to understand which features most influence the predictions.

**Top 3 influential features across counties**:
1. `% Physically Inactive`
2. `% Excessive Drinking`
3. `% Obesity`

The dominant factor varies by region.  
Urban areas show more diverse influences; rural and southeastern U.S. counties cluster around inactivity, smoking, and obesity.

## Data

The dataset includes U.S. county-level data from **2016 to 2019**, including:
- Demographics
- Socioeconomics
- Health behaviors
- Environmental data

## Methodology Summary

1. **Preprocessing**: Merge, clean, and normalize multi-year data  
2. **Feature Selection**: OLS + AIC/BIC to reduce dimensionality  
3. **Model Training**: Compare multiple models on 2016‚Äì2018 data  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Predict 2019, assess performance  
5. **Interpretability**: SHAP to rank feature importance  
6. **Spatial Analysis**: Cluster counties based on SHAP profiles

---

## Conclusion

- **Physical inactivity**, **excessive drinking**, and **obesity** are consistently the strongest predictors of diabetes.
- Regional clustering reveals strong disparities, especially in the Southeast ("Diabetes Belt").
- Though XGBoost outperformed other models, the R¬≤ remains moderate, suggesting more complex or unmeasured factors influence diabetes prevalence.

---

## Future Work

- Integrate **additional geospatial features** (e.g., walkability, food access)
- Use **temporal models** (e.g., LSTM) to capture time trends
- Apply the same pipeline to other chronic diseases (e.g., obesity, heart disease)
